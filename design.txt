There is an opaque "buffer" module. Other modules depend on buffer.

InsertChar
DeleteChar. Precondition: cursor is not at the end of the file
MoveCursorLeft. Precondition: cursor is not at the beginning of the line
MoveCursorBack. Precondition: cursor is not at the beginning of the file
etc.

We can define "simple" versions of these interfaces that make certain assumptions about the text editor (e.g. that no-one else is editing it at the same time, or that there is no extra information such as breakpoints and bookmarks attached to points within the buffer).

Then later on we can define more complex versions of the interfaces and prove that the simple versions are a degenerate case.
